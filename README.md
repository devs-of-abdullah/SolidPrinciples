# SOLID Principles

SOLID principles are five design guidelines intended to make software design more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are foundational in object-oriented design (OOD). They help in avoiding software design issues that can lead to rigid, fragile, and hard-to-maintain code.

The SOLID acronym stands for:

- S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Single Responsipility Principle
- A class should only have one job or one responsiblity
- This principle helps to ensure that each class or module in system does one thing and does it well
## Open/Closed Principle
- A class should be open for extenshions closed for modifications
- This principle helps to add new code without change existing code
