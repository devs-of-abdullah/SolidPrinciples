# SOLID Principles:

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help developers create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. These principles promote better software design and improve scalability and ease of testing.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
- A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have one responsibility.
- Benefit: Enhances code readability and maintainability by reducing complexity. It also makes code easier to refactor.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
- Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Benefit: Makes systems more flexible and adaptable to change without altering existing code, which reduces the risk of introducing bugs.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting program correctness.
- Benefit: Encourages the use of polymorphism, making the code more reusable and reducing the need for duplicated logic.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): 
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Benefit: Prevents "fat" interfaces and promotes a decoupled, modular design. It improves code maintainability and allows for flexible changes.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
- Benefit: Promotes loose coupling between components, making the system easier to change and maintain. It also enhances testability by allowing easier mock or stub replacements for dependencies.
